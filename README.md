## How 3d printer works?

This article will explain how 3d printer works. I wish I could finish this before I die.

It seems like I may never finish this, since the best result I got is not good and I don't know why. I've been stuck here for days, still no clue.

Can someone help me check what's wrong with my code? Really thanks.
